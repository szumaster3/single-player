I'm sorry I can't be more upbeat, but I'm very sad about Harold and Sani. It's terrible to see your comrades cut down in combat, especially those two. They were still so very young.").also { stage++ }
  270 -> npc(FaceAnim.FRIENDLY, "I'm so sad since Sani and Harold were killed. The Myreque will be lonelier without them. Still, at least they didn't suffer.").also { stage++ }

  283 -> npc(FaceAnim.FRIENDLY, "Well, I guess Vanstrom will expect that we're dead. He's so arrogant that he doesn't really consider us a threat. I can understand that; if I was that powerful I would probably feel the same. I guess we'll regroup and then try to recruit more people. We first need to know how we can fight against these monsters, then we'll take the war to them!").also { stage++ }

If you search the wall, you'll find that it is in fact moveable. You should be able to get into the room, take the ladder to come out to the south of the 'Hair of the Dog Tavern' in Canifis. While you're there, you could see if that murderer Vanstrom is still hanging around.").also { stage++ }

  287 -> npc(FaceAnim.FRIENDLY, "Yes, of course, we'll certainly get our revenge on him and his superiors! Then they'll taste the bitter sorrow that we've had to endure so long!").also { stage++ }
